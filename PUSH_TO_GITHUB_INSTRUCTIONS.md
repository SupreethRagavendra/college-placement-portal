# ðŸš€ PUSH TO GITHUB - MANUAL INSTRUCTIONS

## GitHub is Blocking Push Due to API Key in .env.example

### OPTION 1: Allow the Secret (Recommended - Fastest)

GitHub has detected your Groq API key. Since it's only in `.env.example` (not the actual `.env` which is ignored), you can safely allow it.

**Steps:**

1. Click this link that appeared in your terminal:
   ```
   https://github.com/SupreethRagavendra/TEST-DEP-COLLEGE/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/34otlREdwEJigVTeLA225XUkRFa
   ```

2. On GitHub page, click **"Allow secret"** or **"I'll fix it later"**

3. Then run in PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\supree\OneDrive\Documents\college-placement-portals-main (1)\college-placement-portals-main"
   git push -f -u origin main
   ```

### OPTION 2: Temporarily Disable Push Protection

If the link doesn't work:

1. Go to: https://github.com/SupreethRagavendra/TEST-DEP-COLLEGE/settings/security_analysis
2. Scroll to **"Push protection"**
3. Click **"Disable"** (you can re-enable after push)
4. Run push command again:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\supree\OneDrive\Documents\college-placement-portals-main (1)\college-placement-portals-main"
   git push -f -u origin main
   ```
